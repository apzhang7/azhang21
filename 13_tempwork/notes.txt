K13 - Template for Success/Using Flask/Creating flask app using the occupation python data 
October 13 2021

Notes:
- Angela and Deven had similar python implementations of occupation because they imported the file into their new directories. 
Michelle rereated the functions in the various assignments rather than import. 
- We used Michelle's method so that our file tree would match the given one. 

Discoveries:
- Adding more @app.route("/") creates more websites built off of the home http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
- We learned about this last assignment but the {% for ... %} can create python for loops within the HTML code. The {% end for %} is necessary. 

Questions:
- Implementing Reng's debugging method??

Ego:
- Know you can make mistakes
- Don't be personal about your code
- There is someone who always knows more
- Cognitive dissonance 
- Confirmation bias exists
